Welcome to the Rock...Paper...Scissor Game!
Let me tell you the rules to this game.
You and I will get to choose rock, paper, or scissor.
After we made a decision, we will then reveal the choices we both made and decide a winner based on these rules.
Rock beats Scissor!
Paper beats Rock!
Scissor beats Paper!
If we both pick the same option, then it is a tie.
