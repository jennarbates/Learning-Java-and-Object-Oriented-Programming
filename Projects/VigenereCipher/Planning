Input:
    - Two command line parameters
        - name of encryption key file (8 bit ASCII string terminated by a newline character)
            -may contain upper and lower case letters, numbers, and other text -> convert to contiguous lowercase letters
        - name of file to be encrypted
            - no more than 512 letters
            - will generally have non-alphabetic characters to be ignored
            - will contain both uppercase and lowercase letters -> convert to contiguous lowercase letters
            - if less than 512 letters, pad with 'x's until the 512 character buffer is full


Output:
    - Echo processed input to screen
        - lowercase alphabetic text from input key file
        - lowercase alphabetic text derived from input plaintext file
            - remember to pad with x if the processed plaintext is <512 characters
    - Output ciphertext to console screen
        - Formatting:
            - only lowercase letters in rows of exactly 80 letters per row, except for the last row, which may have fewer


Functions likely to be needed:
    - letterGrabber( txt file)
        - grabs only alphabetic characters from a txt file
    - convertToLowercase(string)
        - converts characters into lowercase from uppercase
