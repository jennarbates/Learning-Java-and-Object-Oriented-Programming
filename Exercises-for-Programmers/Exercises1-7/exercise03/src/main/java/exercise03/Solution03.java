/*
 * Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author. Display the quotation and author as shown in the example output.
 *
 * Example Output:
 *   What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
 *   Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
 *   Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."
 *
 * Constraints:
 *      Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
        If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, donâ€™t use it for this exercise. Use string concatenation instead.
        e.g. use println() instead of printf()
 */

/*
 * Pseudocode:
 *      - Prompt user for quote to be stored in a string (output then input)
 *      - Prompt user for author to be stored in a different string (output then input)
 *      - Print author + "says" + \" + quote + \"
 *
